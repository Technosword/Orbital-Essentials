# It is recommended to read the guide at https://luckperms.net/wiki/Prefixes,-Suffixes-&-Meta before setting up the plugin.
#
# Built-in Placeholders:
# {world} = world name
# {prefix} = user's primary prefix
# {prefixes} = user's prefixes sorted by the highest priority
# {name} = player name
# {suffix} = user's primary suffix
# {suffixes} = user's suffixes sorted by the highest priority
# {username-color} = username color for a group or a player
# {message-color} = message color for a group or a player

# A standard chat format for all chat, which will meet almost every user's expectations.
chat-format: "{prefix}{name}&r: {message}"
chat-distance: 200

# Use group formats, if you need e.g. a different placeholder arrangement for different groups.
# Make sure to remove the '#' to allow the setting to be read.
group-formats:
  default: "[default] {name}&r: {message}"
  admin: "[admin] {name}&r: {message}"
